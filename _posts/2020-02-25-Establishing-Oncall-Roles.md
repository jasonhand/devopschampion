# Establishing On-call Roles

## Primary Responder

The first role we need to talk about is the “Primary Responder” – the Primary “On-call” engineer.

## Secondary Responder

Then we have the secondary responder – who is there as back up -Another engineer who can step in if the primary responder is unavailable or unreachable. Or if they just need another pair of eyes.

## Incident Commander

Another key role to identify, in many cases, is the incident commander. An incident commander can be extremely helpful when you have got a large-scale outage that effects a lot of different components or requires coordination across many teams and different systems. They are great for making sure that engineers stay focused and they are working on their own remediation efforts... Ensuring people are not stepping on each other or undoing each other's work.  It is good to have a central person who can track what is going on and who is doing what.  

## Communication Coordinator

The Communication Coordinator is meant to be the person working in conjunction with the incident commander to share more information beyond those who are in the firefight actively working to recover from the incident itself. That could be customers. It could be the sales and marketing teams. Maybe your customer support. There are many people within an organization who need to be made aware of what’s taking place and the status around how things are progressing. It's always good to put someone in charge of managing that communication and making sure that other stakeholders are aware of what is happening and what’s being done.

## Scribe

The scribe’s role is to document the conversation in as much detail as possible. Teams commonly use phone bridges, conference calls, or video chat to get everyone together and try to understand what is going on, which can certainly help create space for the conversation. However, it is difficult for us to go through and understand in detail what the engineers were saying and doing unless it is transcribed. As a result, a scribe is that person who can help us document as much as possible to review later. What were people saying, doing, feeling, and even experiencing?  It is all data to be analyzed – but only if we capture it.

## Subject Matter Experts

It’s quite common within on-call rosters to identify subject matter experts, so that early responders know who to escalate too quickly. These people should not be on call all the time, of course, but we do want to be able to identify who is our database expert. Who is our front-end expert? Who are the people that we can reach out to if our primary and secondary responders are not able to diagnose and resolve the issue themselves?
